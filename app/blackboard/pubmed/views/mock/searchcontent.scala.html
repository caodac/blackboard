@articlecard(27994734, "New Peptidomimetic Boronates for Selective Inhibition of the Chymotrypsin-like Activity of the 26S Proteasome.", 2016){
New Peptidomimetic Boronates for Selective Inhibition of the Chymotrypsin-like Activity of the 26S Proteasome. Proteasome is a large proteinase complex that degrades proteins via its three catalytic activities. Among these activities, the "chymotrypsin-like" activity has emerged as the focus of drug discovery in <b>cancer</b> therapy. Here, we report new peptidomimetic boronates that are highly specific for the chymotrypsin-like catalytic activity of the proteasome. These new specific proteasome <b>inhibitors</b> were demonstrated to have higher in vitro potency and selective cytotoxicity for <b>cancer</b> cells compared to benchmark proteasome <b>inhibitors</b>: bortezomib and carfilzomib. In breast <b>cancer</b> cell lines, treatment with 1a or 2a induced accumulation of the high molecular weight polyubiqutinated proteins at similar levels observed for bortezomib and carfilzomib, indicating that <b>cancer</b> cell death caused by 1a/2a is chiefly due to proteasome inhibition.

A 4-aminoquinoline derivative that markedly sensitizes tumor cell killing by Akt <b>inhibitors</b> with a minimum cytotoxicity to non-<b>cancer</b> cells. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the enhancement value of chloroquine analogs when used in combination with Akt <b>inhibitors</b> on the MDA-MB468, MDA-MB231 and MCF7 human breast <b>cancer</b> cell lines. The result showed that the combination of certain chloroquine analogs and Akt <b>inhibitors</b> are highly effective. In particular, the chloroquine analog N'-(7-fluoro-quinolin-4-yl)-N,N-dimethyl-ethane-1,2-diamine (compound 5) was highly effective in sensitizing <b>cancer</b> cell killing when combined with either Akt inhibitor 8 (1-{1-[4-(7-phenyl-1H-imidazo[4,5-g]quinoxalin-6-yl)-benzyl]-piperidin-4-yl}-1,3-dihydro-benzoimidazol-2-one) or 9 ([4-(2-chloro-4a,10a-dihydro-phenoxazin-10-yl)-butyl]-diethyl-amine hydrochloride). Importantly, the enhancement of chloroquine analogs 5 on cell killing by Akt <b>inhibitors</b> 8 and 9 was <b>cancer</b>-specific. Thus, this combinational approach is highly promising in controlling tumors with a minimum side effect. Structural analysis of effective and ineffective chloroquine analogs suggests that the 4-aminoquinoline scaffold and lateral side chain of dimethylamino functionality play an important role for the enhancement of cell killing by Akt <b>inhibitors</b>.

Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of novel carbohydrate-based sulfamates as carbonic anhydrase <b>inhibitors</b>. Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) IX and XII are enzymes with newly validated potential for the development of personalized, first-in-class <b>cancer</b> chemotherapies. Here we present the design and synthesis of novel carbohydrate-based CA <b>inhibitors</b>, several of which were very efficient <b>inhibitors</b> (K(i)<10 nM) with good selectivity for <b>cancer</b>-associated CA isozymes over off-target CA isozymes. All <b>inhibitors</b> comprised a carbohydrate core with one hydroxyl group derivatized as a sulfamate. Five different carbohydrates were chosen to present a selection of molecular shapes with subtle stereochemical differences to the CA enzymes active site. Variable modifications of the remaining sugar hydroxyl groups were incorporated to provide an incremental coverage of chemical property parameters that are associated with biopharmaceutical performance. All sulfamate <b>inhibitors</b> displayed ligand efficiencies that are consistent with those reported for good drug lead candidates.

@articlecard(25899335,"Synthesis and identification of unprecedented selective inhibitors of CK1ε.", 2015){
Synthesis and identification of unprecedented selective <b>inhibitors</b> of CK1ε. A small and structure-biased library of enantiopure anti-β-amino alcohols was prepared in a straightforward manner by a simplified version of the Reetz protocol. Antiproliferative activity testing against a panel of five human solid tumor cell lines gave GI50 values in the range 1-20 μM. The reverse screening by computational methods against 58 proteins involved in <b>cancer</b> pointed to kinases as possible therapeutic target candidates. The experimental determination of the interaction with 456 kinases indicated that the compounds behave as selective CK1ε <b>inhibitors</b>. Our results demonstrate that the lead compound represents the first selective CK1ε inhibitor with proven antiproliferative activity in <b>cancer</b> cell lines.

Synthesis and biological evaluation of novel oxindole-based RTK <b>inhibitors</b> as anti-<b>cancer</b> agents. Given that receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) have emerged as key regulators of all aspects of <b>cancer</b> development, including proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis, the RTK family represents an important therapeutic target for anti-<b>cancer</b> drug development. Oxindole structure has been used in RTK <b>inhibitors</b> such as SU4984 and intedanib. In this study, two series of new heterocyclic compounds containing oxindole scaffold have been designed and synthesized, and their inhibitory activity against the proliferation of nine <b>cancer</b> cell lines has been evaluated. Among them, compounds 9a and 9b displayed the strongest anti-proliferative activity with the IC50s below 10μM. Flow cytometric analysis showed that the compounds 9a and 9b dose-dependently arrested the cell cycle at G0/G1 phase. Although the leading compounds SU4984 and intedanib targets FGFR1, the kinase activity test revealed that these compounds only showed slight inhibitory activity on FGFR1 kinase. Further enzymatic test aided by molecular docking simulation in the ATP-binding site demonstrated that 9a and 9b are potent <b>inhibitors</b> of c-Kit kinase. These compounds are worthy of further evaluation as anticancer agents.

@articlecard(27783978, "Recent discovery of non-nucleobase thymidine phosphorylase inhibitors targeting cancer.", 2016){
Recent discovery of non-nucleobase thymidine phosphorylase <b>inhibitors</b> targeting <b>cancer</b>. Thymidine phosphorylase (TP, EC 2.4.2.4), an enzyme involved in pyrimidine salvage pathway, is identical to platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF) and gliostatin. It is extremely upregulated in a variety of solid tumours. The TP amplification is associated with concomitant overexpression of many angiogenic factors such as matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), interleukins (ILs), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) etc., resulting in promotion of angiogenesis and <b>cancer</b> metastasis. In addition, overshooting TP level protects tumour cells from apoptosis and helps cell survival. Thus, TP is identified as a prime target for developing novel anticancer therapies. Pioneering research activities investigated a large number of TP <b>inhibitors</b>, most of which are pyrimidine or purine analogues. Recently, an array of structurally diverse non-nucleobase derivatives was designed, synthesized and established as promising TP <b>inhibitors</b>. This review, following an outline on the TP structure and functions, gives an overview of the recent advancement of various non-nucleobase TP <b>inhibitors</b> as novel anti-<b>cancer</b> agents.

Anti-tumor pyrimidinylpiperazines bind to the prosurvival Bcl-2 protein family member Bcl-XL. Overexpression of prosurvival or underexpression of pro-death Bcl-2 family proteins can lead to <b>cancer</b> cell resistance to chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Inhibition of the prosurvival Bcl-2 family proteins has become a strategy for <b>cancer</b> therapy and <b>inhibitors</b> are currently being evaluated in the clinic both as single agents and in combination with established drugs. Here we describe the design, synthesis, and evaluation of pyrimidylpiperazines that were discovered to be <b>inhibitors</b> of the prosurvival Bcl-2 protein family member Bcl-XL. This study identified compound 21 which demonstrated a GI(50) value of 8.4 μM against A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells and a binding affinity K(i) value for Bcl-XL of 127 nM.

Structure-activity studies of Wnt/β-catenin inhibition in the Niclosamide chemotype: Identification of derivatives with improved drug exposure. The Wnt signaling pathway plays a key role in regulation of organ development and tissue homeostasis. Dysregulated Wnt activity is one of the major underlying mechanisms responsible for many diseases including <b>cancer</b>. We previously reported the FDA-approved anthelmintic drug Niclosamide inhibits Wnt/β-catenin signaling and suppresses colon <b>cancer</b> cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Niclosamide is a multi-functional drug that possesses important biological activity in addition to inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Here, we studied the SAR of Wnt signaling inhibition in the anilide and salicylamide region of Niclosamide. We found that the 4'-nitro substituent can be effectively replaced by trifluoromethyl or chlorine and that the potency of inhibition was dependent on the substitution pattern in the anilide ring. Non-anilide, N-methyl amides and reverse amide derivatives lost significant potency, while acylated salicylamide derivatives inhibited signaling with potency similar to non-acyl derivatives. Niclosamide's low systemic exposure when dosed orally may hinder its use to treat systemic disease. To overcome this limitation we identified an acyl derivative of Niclosamide, DK-520 (compound 32), that significantly increased both the plasma concentration and the duration of exposure of Niclosamide when dosed orally. The studies herein provide a medicinal chemical foundation to improve the pharmacokinetic exposure of Niclosamide and Wnt-signaling <b>inhibitors</b> based on the Niclosamide chemotype. The identification of novel derivatives of Niclosamide that metabolize to Niclosamide and increase its drug exposure may provide important research tools for in vivo studies and provide drug candidates for treating cancers with dysregulated Wnt signaling including drug-resistant cancers. Moreover, since Niclosamide is a multi-functional drug, new research tools such as DK520 could directly result in novel treatments against bacterial and viral infection, lupus, and metabolic diseases such as type II diabetes, NASH and NAFLD.
